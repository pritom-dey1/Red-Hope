# Blood Connector ü©∏

**A Zero Boundaries Hackathon Project**  
Connects blood *donors* and *receivers* with real-time chat, map view, notifications, and more ‚Äî built in Django + JS.

---

## üîç Problem Statement

In many places, people in urgent need of blood don‚Äôt know who nearby donors are; communication is slow; coordination and updates (availability, unread messages, donor status) are missing.  

**Blood Connector** aims to solve this by:

- Showing nearby donors on a map
- Letting receivers post blood requests
- Alerting donors of new requests via notifications  
- Enabling real-time messaging
- Showing availability & donation history  
- Managing read/unread states so nothing is missed

## üéØ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **User Roles** | Donors & Receivers. Each user has a profile (blood group, picture, etc.). |
| **Donor Availability** | Donors can mark themselves available or unavailable. |
| **Map Integration** | Interactive map (Leaflet + OpenStreetMap) shows donor locations; users see donors near them. |
| **Blood Request Posts** | Receivers can post requests (blood group, location, problem). |
| **Notifications** | When a donor request is posted, relevant donors are notified. Unread notification count shown. |
| **Chat System** | AJAX-based chat between users (donors/receivers/token participants), with polling to get new messages. Unread badge for messages. |
| **Unread / Read States** | Notifications and chat messages track read/unread so you never miss anything. |
| **Contact Form** | Visitors or users can send messages via contact form (AJAX) in website. |
| **Donor-Request Approval Flow** | Receivers post requests; donors apply/donate; receiver can approve or reject. Notification sent on approval/rejection. |
| **Donation Restrictions & History** | If someone donated recently, restrict donation again before a cooldown period. Track donation history. |
| **Profile Picture Upload** | Users can upload / change profile pictures. |
| **Animations & Smooth UX** | GSAP + Locomotive Scroll for smooth scroll, hero animations, mobile menu toggles, modal windows etc. |

## üìë How It Works (Flow)

1. **Registration & Verification**  
   - User registers (username, blood group, role)  
   - Verification code emailed; activates account  

2. **Posting & Searching**  
   - Receiver posts a blood request (specifying group, location)  
   - Donors get notifications, see posts in ‚Äúpluse‚Äù (feed)  

3. **Chat & Communication**  
   - Users can open chats; AJAX polling fetches new messages  
   - Unread message badges update in real time  

4. **Donor Map & Geolocation**  
   - If allowed, user's location fetched  
   - Map centers on user; nearby donor pins shown  

5. **Notification System**  
   - Requests ‚Üí relevant donors get notification entries  
   - Notification modal, unread count, mark as read  

6. **Approval / Rejection Workflow**  
   - Donor applies to a request  
   - Receiver approves or rejects; email sent accordingly  

7. **Contact / Comments**  
   - Users may send messages via contact form  
   - Commenting on posts supported
